        This code defines an array called `studentRecords` containing objects representing student records with their names, IDs, and marks. It then declares an empty array called `UpperCase`. Using the `map` function, it transforms the `studentRecords` array by extracting the names of the students and converting them to uppercase. The resulting uppercase names are stored in the `UpperCase` array.

        This code defines an array called `studentRecords` containing objects representing student records with their names, IDs, and marks. It then declares an empty array called `students`. Using the `filter` method, it filters the `studentRecords` array based on the condition that only students with marks greater than 50 should be included. The filtered results are stored in the `students` array. Finally, the `students` array is logged to the console, displaying the student records that meet the specified condition (marks greater than 50).

      <h4>Output:-  241</h4>
      <h4>explanation:-</h4>
      <p>
        This code initializes the sumOfMarks variable to 0. The reduce method is then used to iterate over each student in the studentRecords array and accumulate their marks by adding them to the accumulator. Finally, the sum of all marks is logged to the console. In this case, the output would be 241 since the sum of 98 + 23 + 45 + 75 is 241.

Finally, the array containing the names of the students with marks greater than 50 is logged to the console.

      <p>
        This code first uses the map method to iterate over each student record and check if their marks are less than 50. If so, it adds a grace of 15 marks by creating a new object with the updated marks. Otherwise, it keeps the original student record unchanged. Then, the filter method is used to filter out students whose marks are still greater than 50 after the grace has been applied. Finally, the reduce method calculates the total marks by accumulating the marks of the filtered students. The resulting total marks are logged to the console

      <p>
        In this code, we define an array studentObjects that contains six objects, each representing a student. Each object has properties such as name, class, and rollNo. The objects are initialized with the respective values based on the given dataset. Finally, we log the studentObjects array to the console to verify its contents.
